# AI Buddy repository rules

This repository owns the desktop product around an unmodified DeepSeek Harness checkout.

## Prerequisites and setup

- Use Node.js `^22.19.0` or `>=24.0.0` and the root Yarn `4.18.0` release through Corepack.
- Initialize the pinned upstream checkout with `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- Install root dependencies with `corepack yarn install --immutable`.

## Build, run, and verify

- Start the desktop development workflow with `corepack yarn dev`.
- Build the desktop package with `corepack yarn build`.
- Run unit tests with `corepack yarn test`.
- Run type checking with `corepack yarn typecheck`.
- Run the complete headless gate with `corepack yarn check`.
- Run upstream operations through the root scripts, such as `corepack yarn upstream:build`.

- `deepseek-harness/` is a pinned upstream Git submodule. Never edit files inside it from a desktop feature branch.
- `dsh-plugin-desktop/` owns the Cordis Host and Client faces, Electron bootstrap, packaging, and release tests. It also owns the worker-pack recommendations (workspace plugins plus starting DingTalk Stream and WeCom AI Bot channels), official MCP settings (`dsh-plugin-desktop/mcp`), and the default-off workbench Host (`dsh-plugin-desktop/workbench`: Command Palette, local-model discovery, data-home migration, remote control plane). Those are opt-in defaults, not an install allowlist: do not silently npm-install community plugins, do not ship MCP/DingTalk/WeCom tokens, and do not blocklist community packages from the market or `dsh plugin add`. Desktop-owned Host surfaces must stay off by default and keep composing with community plugins. Do not replace official layout, sidebar, or conversation in compatibility mode, and do not stream the Electron window as a remote desktop.
- `dsh-community-fabric/` owns the community interoperability RFC. Until schemas and a reviewed reference adapter exist, it remains a private documentation scaffold and must not declare loadable DSH or package entry points.
- `dsh-community-market/` owns the built-in community plugin market. It provides loadable Host and Client entries composed into the desktop profile; catalog inclusion is not a security review.
- The outer repository and all owned packages use the root Yarn release with `nodeLinker: node-modules`.
- The upstream submodule keeps its own pnpm workspace. Run upstream commands through the root `upstream:*` scripts, whose Yarn portable-shell commands enter the submodule before invoking Corepack.
- Compatibility mode must run the upstream default client without overrides. Advanced presentation belongs to desktop-owned client plugins and may replace documented slots or services through profile composition.
- Keep graphical application launch explicit. Builds, typechecks, unit tests, and Loader smokes must remain headless-safe.
- Commit before major changes of direction and keep the submodule pin update separate from desktop behavior changes.
- Keep the repository topology and package-manager split consistent with the [owning Agent Note](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-15-pinned-upstream-and-isolated-yarn-workspace.md).
