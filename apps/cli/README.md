# `@deepseek-ai/dsh`

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The `dsh` command is the product launcher for profiles: ordered stacks of plugin-bundle patch layers under the user's own overrides. [`src/args.ts`](src/args.ts) owns the command grammar, and [`src/bin.ts`](src/bin.ts) loads only the selected runner. Invalid commands, options from another mode, configuration errors, and boot failures exit nonzero.

## Entry modes

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dsh --profile <name>` | Boot the named profile under `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<name>`. |
| `dsh --profile headless "job"` | Run one fresh persisted session, print the final answer, and exit. |
| `dsh web` | Alias of `--profile web`. |
| `dsh web --safe-mode` | Boot Web from shipped bundles while skipping profile and home custom patches for this run. |
| `dsh plugin --profile <name> <pnpm args>` | Manage a profile's plugins by forwarding to pnpm in the profile directory. |

The invoking directory is the default workspace root. The `web` and `headless` profiles auto-initialize on first use from shipped templates; any other profile must be created through `dsh plugin`.

## App arguments

The launcher parses only its own flags and hands everything after them to the booted profile, where any injected app plugin may parse the shared immutable snapshot ([`dsh-cmdline`](../../packages/boot/cmdline/README.md)). Launcher flags therefore come first, and the first token the launcher does not recognize starts the app's arguments:

```sh
dsh --profile web --port 8080       # --port belongs to the web app
dsh --profile tui --resume <id>     # example, assuming the tui profile is installed; --resume belongs to the terminal app
dsh --profile headless "run the tests"
dsh --profile web --help            # the web app's flags, not the launcher's
dsh --help                          # the launcher's own help
```

## Profiles

A profile directory holds a `package.json` (out-of-tree plugin dependencies plus the profile manifest `dsh.profile` with its ordered `bundles` list) and a `cordis.patch.yml` (the user's own patch layer).

The tree composes over an empty root:
- each bundle's patch in `dsh.profile.bundles` order
- then the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`, then the home-level `$DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml`
- then `--patch` overlays

Bundles named in `dsh.profile.bundles` resolve from the dsh installation first (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-base`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-headless`), then from the profile's own `node_modules`, where pnpm installs out-of-tree plugins.

Use `--dump-default-config` and `--dump-config` to inspect the composed tree without booting it.

Safe Mode prepares the selected profile when needed, keeps its installed dependencies and persisted application data, and boots the shipped bundle layers plus internal agent preset and telemetry overlays. It skips the profile `cordis.patch.yml`, the home-level patch, and both patch watchers for the current process. `--safe-mode` is mutually exclusive with `--patch` and the configuration-dump flags.

The [CLI behavior reference](reference/README.md) owns exact layer precedence, flags, shutdown behavior, deployment defaults, and source execution.

## Development

Production runs require built package and frontend artifacts. From the repository root, run `pnpm run build` separately, then use `pnpm dsh <args...>` to run the TypeScript entry and forward every argument; the [source-execution reference](reference/README.md#source-execution) owns the module-resolution contract.
